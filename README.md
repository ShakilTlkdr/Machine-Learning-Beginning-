🧠 My First Machine Learning Project: Predicting Concrete Compressive Strength 🏗️
Welcome to my very first machine learning project! 🚀
This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete, a crucial factor in construction and structural engineering.

📌 Project Highlights:
📊 Dataset: Collected from Kaggle

🧪 Models Implemented:

Linear Regression – simple and interpretable baseline

Random Forest Regressor – for better performance with nonlinear relationships

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

NumPy, Pandas – data manipulation and numerical analysis

Scikit-learn – machine learning models and metrics

Seaborn, Matplotlib – data visualization and EDA

🎯 Objective:
To explore how various ingredients of concrete (like cement, water, and aggregates) affect its compressive strength, and to build models that can accurately predict it.

This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of machine learning and data science.
I’m excited to keep learning and improving—feedback is most welcome! 🙌
